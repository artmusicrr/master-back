# npm resolution error report

While resolving: master-back@0.0.1
Found: @nestjs/common@10.3.8
node_modules/@nestjs/common
  @nestjs/common@"10.3.8" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @nestjs/common@"^11.0.2" from @nestjs/serve-static@5.0.3
node_modules/@nestjs/serve-static
  @nestjs/serve-static@"^5.0.3" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
